<h3>Bing Alexa Transit Sysytem</h3>
<b>Inspiration</b><br>
The need to learn something new and dive into different tech Inspired us to try out Alexa skills. The Binghamton bus service was an excellent candidate to be moved to Alexa.

<b>What it does</b><br>
Given a Bus route , BATS will let you know the when closest bus on that route will reach you. It also lets you know the distance of the bus from your location.

<b>How I built it</b><br>
BATS is built using Alexa skills development kit using lambda function , google maps api, OCCT api and coded in JAVA

<b>Challenges I ran into </b><br>
Alexa Skill was completely new to us and we had to start from scratch. Also finding the relevant API to get things working was a big challenge

<b>Accomplishments that I'm proud of </b><br>
This being our first Hackathon, we successfully completed what we had planned for and we gave our best. BATS will forever be special for us

<b>What I learned</b><br>
Basic Alexa development, API implementations and some part of competitive coding.

<b>What's next for BATS (Bing Alexa Transit System)</b><br>
BATS can improve by incorporating more transit systems like MARTA, VMATA etc.
